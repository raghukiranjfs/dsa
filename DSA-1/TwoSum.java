/*Given an array of integers as input, output the indices of two numbers in the array which add up to a specified target.

Assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you cannot use the same element twice. If 2 different elements have the same value, they can be used.

Print the indices in increasing order.

Input format
First line contains an Integer N that represents the number of elements in the array.

Second line contains N space separated integers, which are members of the array.

Third line contains an integer X, which is the target value.

Output format
Print two space separated indices(in increasing order) of the numbers which add up to the specified target.

Constraints
2 <= Length of array <= 100000

1 <= Range of values <= 1000000

Sample Input 1
5 --> Number of elements in array

2 4 5 9 8 --> Array elements

7 --> Target sum value

Sample Output 1
0 2

Explanation 1
Since 0 and 2 are the indices where the numbers 2 and 5 which add up to 7 are seen/*

Crio Methodology

Milestone 1: Understand the problem clearly
1. Ask questions & clarify the problem statement clearly.
2. Take an example or two to confirm your understanding of the input/output

Milestone 2: Finalize approach & execution plan
1. Understand what type of problem you are solving and see if you can recollect solving similar problems in the past
      a. Obvious logic (this would only test ability to convert logic to code)
      b. Figuring out logic
      c. Knowledge of specific algorithm, data structure or pattern
      d. Knowledge of specific domain or concepts
      e. Mapping real world into abstract concepts/data structures
2. Brainstorm multiple ways to solve the problem and pick one based on the TC/SC requirements
3. Get to a point where you can explain your approach to a 10 year old

Milestone 3 : Come up with an Instruction Manual for a 10 year old
1. Take a stab at the high-level logic & write it down like a detailed Instruction Manual for a 10 Year old where each line of the manual can be expanded into a logical line(s) of code.
2. Try to offload logic out of the main section as much as possible by delegating to functions.

Milestone 4: Code by expanding your 10 Year Olds "Instruction Manual
1. Run your code snippets at every logical step to test correctness (Helps avoid debugging larger pieces of code later)
2. Make sure you name the variables, functions clearly.
3. Use libraries as much as possible

Milestone 5: Prove that your code works using custom test cases
1. Make sure you check boundary conditions and other test cases you noted in Milestone 1
      a. If compiler is not available, dry run your code on a whiteboard or paper
2. Suggest optimizations if applicable during interviews
